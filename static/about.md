Hi I'm Mark Judy. I work at IBM. I'm interested in software development and
computers in general. In my free time I lift 🏋️‍♂️, play ultimate frisbee 🥏, cycle
🚴‍♂️, and sometimes run 🏃‍♂️! My favorite programming languages are TypeScript,
Rust, and Golang.

Some of my favorite books include:

- _Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly_
  by Anthony Bourdain
- _The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann_ by Ananyo
  Bhattacharya
- _The Three-Body Problem_ by Liu Cixin
- _Dune_ by Frank Herbert
