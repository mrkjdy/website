Hi, I'm Mark Judy. I'm interested in software development and computers in
general. In my free time I lift 🏋️‍♂️, play ultimate frisbee 🥏, cycle 🚴‍♂️, and
sometimes run 🏃‍♂️! My favorite programming languages are TypeScript, Rust, and
Golang.

Some of my favorite books include:

- _Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly_
  by Anthony Bourdain
- _The Three-Body Problem_ by Liu Cixin
- _Dune_ by Frank Herbert
- _The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann_ by Ananyo
